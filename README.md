### Code Description
Before executing the python notebook be sure to install keras and numpy. For installing first check if you have python installed.
Head over to `python.org` to install python. When installed run command prompt. Execute the command `pip install keras` and then `pip install numpy`.
These codes will successfully install keras and numpy modules in your system.
<br>
<br>
The python notebook is commented in each block to make it easier to understand.
<p>
The code Follows the following approach::
<br>
  1) importing all the required modules  <br>
  2) Initialising the CNN <br>
  3) Step 1 - Convolution <br>
  4) Step 2 - Pooling <br>
  5) adding another convolution layer to improve the accuracy <br>
  6) Step 3 - Flattening <br>
  7) Step 4 - Full connection <br>
  8) Compiling the CNN <br>
  9) fit CNN to images <br>
  10) the training set <br>
  11) the test set <br>
  12) predictions for face without mask using train model <br>
  13) predictions for face with mask image using train model <br>
